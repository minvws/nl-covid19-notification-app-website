    You're one of the first people in The Netherlands to use CoronaMelder

You can only get notifications from people tested for coronavirus by the GGD in the IJsselland, Noord- and Oost-Gelderland, Gelderland-Zuid, Drenthe and Twente regions.

It's smart of you to have downloaded the app so quickly. This way, you'll immediately help to stop the spread of the coronavirus.
