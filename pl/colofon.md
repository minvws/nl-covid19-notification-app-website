The CoronaMelder app has been developed by the Ministry of Public Health,
Welfare and Sport in collaboration with the RIVM and the national GGD
institutions. The app could not have been realised without the help of dozens of
experts, experience experts and a large civilian open-source community, who has
monitored the process and tested the app as it was being developed. Everything
has been done to create a safe, accessible and user-friendly app that ensures
your privacy. And that helps to get —&nbsp;and keep&nbsp;— the coronavirus under control.

## Source code

The app's source code and its backend systems are all publicly available. You
can find all code on <a href="https://github.com/minvws" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>. This way, the precise
way the app works is verifiable and controllable by many people, who can also
help discover any potential vulnerabilities.
