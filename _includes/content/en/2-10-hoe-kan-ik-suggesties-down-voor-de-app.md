The CoronaMelder app has been developed by the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport in partnership with RIVM and the GGD throughout the Netherlands. The app would not have been possible without the help of dozens of specialists, experts by experience and a large open-source community of citizens who monitored and took part in trials during the development process. Every effort has been made to deliver a privacy-friendly, secure, accessible and user-friendly app that helps to get and keep the coronavirus under control.

If you have any suggestions for improving the app, you can still pass these on to the CoronaMelder helpline. Call the helpline on <a href="tel:0800-1280">0800-1280</a> (free). It is available from 8:00–18:00, Monday–Friday. You can also send an email to <a href="mailto:helpdesk@coronamelder.nl">helpdesk@coronamelder.nl</a>.

All code for the app can also be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/minvws). If you have any suggestions about code or technology, you can pass them on directly to the design team via GitHub.
