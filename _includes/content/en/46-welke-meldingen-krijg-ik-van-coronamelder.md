You will receive notifications from the CoronaMelder app and from your telephone's operating system - from your Android phone or iPhone.

## You will receive the following notifications from the CoronaMelder app:

### 1. A warning if you have been near someone with coronavirus.

A telephone notification with the text: You may have been near somebody with coronavirus. On X, you have been near somebody with coronavirus. Open the app for more information.

If you receive this notification, it means you have been near someone who has tested positive for coronavirus and you were near them for a longer period of time. Open the notification and follow the advice in the app.

Later, you will also receive a reminder notification, in case you missed it:

### 2. Notifications about the functioning of the app

![A telephone notification with the text: The CoronaMelder app is not currently active. Check your settings](/media/beeldmateriaal/exposure-vanuit-coronamelder/CM_3.png)

If you see this notification, you may have switched off Bluetooth. On older Android phones, your location settings also need to be switched on. This does not mean that CoronaMelder knows your location; this is necessary in order to use Bluetooth Low Energy. Also see: [I use an Android phone. Why do my location settings need to be switched on?](/{{page.lang}}/faq/14-locatie-instellingen-android/).

![A telephone notification with the text: The App needs to be updated. Ensure the app is updated to keep it working properly.](/media/beeldmateriaal/exposure-vanuit-coronamelder/CM_5.png)

If you see this notification, you know that a newer version of CoronaMelder has been released. You should update the app on your phone as soon as possible. Then open the CoronaMelder app for further instructions.

![A telephone notification with the text: Technical problem. In the past 24 hours, the app has not been able to check whether the people you were near have tested positive for coronavirus.](/media/beeldmateriaal/exposure-vanuit-coronamelder/CM_7.png)

This notification indicates that there has been a technical problem with the app. CoronaMelder has been unable to download information about new infections. This could be because your Wi-Fi is not working properly, or because CoronaMelder is not allowed to use mobile data. Open the CoronaMelder app for further instructions. Also see: [I use an Android phone. Why do my location settings need to be switched on?](/{{page.lang}}/faq/14-locatie-instellingen-android/).


### 3. Notification after a break

![A telephone notification with the text: Switch CoronaMelder back on. Reminder: the app is not currently active. You need to activate the app again inside the app.](/media/beeldmateriaal/exposure-vanuit-coronamelder/CM_6.png)

Many people use the pause button. For example, when school children need to hand in their telephone in class and put it in a 'telephone bag'. Or people who are exercising outside, while maintaining a distance of 1.5 metres, but leave their phone in their bag close to other peopleâ€™s bags.

This notification reminds you to turn the app back on. Open CoronaMelder to reactivate the app.
## You will receive the following notifications from iOS (iPhone)

![A telephone notification with the text:  Monthly update. Your iPhone is still searching for potential exposures for you.](/media/beeldmateriaal/exposure-vanuit-ios/iOS_5.png)

If you tap on this notification, you will see how often your iPhone has checked whether you were near someone who has tested positive for coronavirus in the past month.
