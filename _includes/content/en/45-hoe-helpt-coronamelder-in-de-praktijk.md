## Dutch family: "Thanks to CoronaMelder, we did not infect others"

**Completely out of the blue on a friday evening, Len Vliet from Dordrecht (The Netherlands) received a notification in the CoronaMelder app. He had been close to someone who later turned out to have corona. In the end, he, his wife Renate, and his two sons were all infected. Renate: "Len and I had quite a few corona related symptoms."**

CoronaMelder warns app users who have been in the vicinity of someone who later appears to have corona. More than 4.6 million people have downloaded the app since its launch. And more than 115,000 people reported in the app that they were infected. Len was one of them: "Renate and I had CoronaMelder installed on our mobile phones since the autumn. I never expected to get a notification. But when I got one, we immediately decided we should quarantine the whole family. Actually I was the only one who was expected to go into quarantine. Still, we played it safe."

## No complaints, test anyway

If you download CoronaMelder like Renate and Len, you do not have to enter any personal details. The app does not know your name, your e-mail address, or your phone number. CoronaMelder also does not work with location data (GPS). The app does not know who you are or where you are. Do you receive a notification? Then the app will give you advice about going into quarantine and about getting tested. Even if you have no symptoms yet. Because even without symptoms, you can already be contagious. Len: "When I got tested, I had no problems at all. Nevertheless, I turned out to be positive when I looked at the results on www.coronatest.nl in the evening. I immediately went into isolation. Pretty intense, to not be allowed to be with your family at all. During dinner, I would make video calls from my own room with my wife and sons who were eating downstairs."

### Advice from the GGD

The Vliet family received advice from the GGD by telephone. Renate: "Len got his own room and toilet, was the last to take a shower and we were absolutely not allowed to use each other's towels. Nevertheless, a few days later, I got vague complaints like headaches. Because you have someone with corona in your house, you're extra alert. That is why I got tested immediately. In the evening, I also turned out to have corona and was advised to go into isolation. Since we could not leave our sons to their own devices, Len went out of his strict isolation. Of course, he stayed at home. We talked to our sons about the odds that they too would have been infected. They then had themselves tested over the weekend. After the test, they also turned out positive."

### Impact on the family

Renate and Len had quite a few corona complaints. In fact, Renate was so bad that she was home for a few weeks. Their sons have not really been ill. Len: "The youngest felt poorly for a day. The oldest has had no problems. They had to stay indoors, of course. The PlayStation was fully utilized! They followed education online. They were happy when they were allowed to go out again."

### CoronaMelder useful

Thanks to the report in CoronaMelder, the Vliet family was prevented from unknowingly passing the virus to people around them. Without the notice, Len would have gone to a care facility for work and Renate to primary school where she is the headmistress. Renate: "It's a comforting idea that we didn't walk around there with corona. For the time being, I will keep the app on my mobile for that reason. I like to do my part in the fight against corona."
