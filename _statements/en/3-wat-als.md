If you get a notification, it means you have been near someone who has tested positive for coronavirus. Don’t panic: this does not mean for sure that you have coronavirus too. It means you have been in a high-risk situation and that you could have been infected with coronavirus. 

By staying at home, you can reduce the chance of infecting other people.
 
You will be advised to get tested for coronavirus seven days after the day you were exposed to the virus. The notification will tell you which day this was. You should get tested even if you have no symptoms. If you develop symptoms earlier than seven days afterwards, you should get tested sooner. 

Call 0800-1202 to arrange a coronavirus test, free of charge.
