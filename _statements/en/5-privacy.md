The app exchanges random codes with other phones. These codes do not contain any personal information about you, or any information about your location. The app does not know where you are, or who you are.

Even if you test positive for coronavirus and you report this in the app, this information can never be linked to your name or contact details. And you are also completely free to choose whether you want to use the app or not.
