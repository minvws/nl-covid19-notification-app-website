- Explain why the app is needed, what the app does and how CoronaMelder works
- Give answers to frequently asked questions about CoronaMelder and debunk misconceptions
- Provide the current privacy statement, accessibility statement, colophon and version information of CoronaMelder
- Refer to the iOS App Store and Android Google Play Store to install CoronaMelder on a smartphone
- Offer contact channels for other questions about CoronaMelder

Disclaimer
------------------------------------

The design and development of the website started as a volunteering project [in the community](https://minvws.github.io/nl-covid19-notification-app-community-website/). The Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport has built the current website on the foundation created by community members.

Do you want to get in touch with the people involved in designing and building the website? Join the [CodeForNL Slack](https://doemee.codefor.nl/) and go to the `#coronamelder-website` channel. Although the primary language used on the channel is Dutch you should feel free to join the conversation in English.

## Development & Contribution process 

The development team works directly from this open-source repository. If you plan to propose changes, we recommend opening an issue beforehand where we can discuss your planned changes. This increases the chance that we’re able to use your contribution (or it avoids doing work if there are reasons why we wouldn't be able to use it).
