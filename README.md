**Goals:**
Provide a clear overview of which areas the team is working on and eliminate misunderstanding:
"That app should be there anyway, the government will carry on !!" No, we're investigating.
"The government can access my contacts and keep an eye on me all day" No, everything stays on your phone, the government can never technically access it. This is different for central solutions, but in NL we opted for decentralized.
"The screens look as if they are ready, tomorrow it will be finished!" No, we are still investigating many things. It is only finished when everything is green.

_Make it clear that this is partly a community driven project. Everyone is allowed to contribute, criticize, etc._

**Design principles**
* Clarity and usability over eye candy
* Test results on the target group, guerilla testing in the supermarket
* Mobile usable
* Digitally accessible
* Connecting with the design principles of User Central.

#For discussion

The team of the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport (VWS) remains  responsible for the content., because it is best to oversee the discussions and sentiments that take place in different communities (Edo opinion).

At the same time, feedback on status website must be easily accessible, because we do not want to give the impression that this dashboard is propaganda.
Perhaps publishing the text and code on Github is a good way to do that. If the VWS team then dominates the discussion too much and ignores suggestions without explanation, everyone can fork out an alternative dashboard. In any case, forks are quite fine, because everyone can then constructively explain their wishes: when is it good?

**To process**
Respond to recommendations at veiligtegencorona.nl, letter from 60 scientists, user-centered statement, etc.
