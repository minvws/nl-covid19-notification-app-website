Goals of the website:
---------------------

Before the app is finished, the main goal is to **inform** visitors:

* Goal 1: Provide a clear overview of which areas the team is working on / what the project status is.
* Goal 2: Eliminate common misunderstandings such as:
  * "The app will be launched no matter what, the government is ignoring all the pitfalls!" --> No, we're investigating and building concurrently
  * "The government can access my contacts and track me all day" --> No, everything stays on your phone, the government can never technically access it. This is different for central solutions, but in NL we opted for a decentralized approach.
  * "The screens look as if they are finished, the app will be launched tomorrow!" --> No, we are still investigating many things.
* Goal 3: What will the app do? What is it? Why is an app necessary?
* Goal 4: Make it clear that this is partly a community driven project. Everyone is allowed to contribute, criticize, etc.
* Goal 5: Be transparant in our approach
* Goal 6: Communicate clearly when the government will decide whether to actually roll out the app after it has been finished.

After the app is finished a new goal is added:

* Goal 7: **convince** people to download and use the app


How this website came about (pinging journalists) 
------------------------------------

There is a nice story to be told about how the website was created. It all started with a high-level traffic light dashboard idea to indicate the status of the project. This idea was adopted by the community, that let this project evolve (via Github and Slack) from the traffic dashboard to what is now the project website-to-be. The whole process can be followed via [Channel notificatie-app-website](https://app.slack.com/client/T68FXPFQV/C0151NCG140) ([join Slack workspace here](https://doemee.codefor.nl/)). 
Please ping any of the people involved via Slack if you are interested in writing an article about this.
