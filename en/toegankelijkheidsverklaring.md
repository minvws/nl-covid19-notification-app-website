## What is an accessible website?

An accessible website is better usable for all groups it is aimed at. This is why governmental websites must meet functional, technical and editorial [accessibility requirements](https://www.digitoegankelijk.nl/) (earlier called webrichtlijnen, 'web guidelines').

The CoronaMelder app follows the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/REC-WCAG21-20180605/) on level AA as set out in the European standard EN 301 549. If this European standard is updated with specific guidelines for mobile applications, we will follow them.


## Guarantee of Accessibility

We guarantee good accessibility by various measures in our daily processes:

- From day one accessibility has been kept in mind during the design, implementation and editorial stages of this website.
- The website has been validated using an automated accessibility tool, and any problems it turned up have been resolved.
- Two experts were involved to verify accessibility, neither of whom were part of the building team.
- Accessibility will be submitted to a formal investigation to ensure WCAG-EM standards are met. This will involve an examination of functional and technical features as well as editorial aspects. Should there be any difficulties these will be resolved once and for all.
- Planning for investigation to be conducted on 15 October 2020.
- Expert knowledge of accessibility will be kept up to standard and applied when needed by our staff.


## Parts of the site to be improved 

Presently no accessibility problems are known.
