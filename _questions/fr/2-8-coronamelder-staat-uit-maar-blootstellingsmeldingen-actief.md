It appears that some phones continue to exchange Bluetooth signals (anonymously or otherwise) even after the app has been turned off. This problem occurs with both iOS and Android. We expect to be able to solve this problem later this week. No action is required on your part.

Since the CoronaMelder app was deactivated on 22 April, you will no longer receive notifications if you have been in contact with someone with the coronavirus.
