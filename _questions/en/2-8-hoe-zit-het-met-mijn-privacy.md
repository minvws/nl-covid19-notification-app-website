The app is secure. We make sure that:

- The app is being tested and checked all the time.
- The app does not know your name or any other personal details.
- Nobody can force you to use the app.
- Experts from inside and outside the government have helped to build the app.
- On a voluntary basis, hundreds of experts check the quality, privacy and safety aspects of the app. The app works entirely on the basis of transparent and open-source principles.

## How does the app deal with personal data?

The app exchanges random codes with other phones. These codes do not contain any data about you or your location. So the app does not know who you are or where you are.

Even if you are infected with coronavirus and you report this via the app, this cannot be linked to your name or contact details. You are also completely free to choose whether or not you use the app.

This also applies to the corona apps from other EU countries with which CoronaMelder exchanges codes. CoronaMelder only works with corona apps that fully meet the same privacy requirements. Just like in the Netherlands, CoronaMelder and the other corona apps do not know who you are or where you are.
