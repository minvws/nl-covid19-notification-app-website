If you have been near someone who later tests positive for coronavirus, and if that person adds their positive status to the app:
- You will receive a notification. It is possible that you have been infected too, even if you do not feel unwell (yet).
- You can then arrange a test at the GGD and stay at home until you know the result. This means you can avoid passing coronavirus on to other people.  

If you test positive for coronavirus yourself:
- The GGD will ask you who you have been near to, and the GGD will also call these people.	
- Together with an employee of the GGD you can enter your coronavirus status in the app. When a GGD- employee calls you with the test result, they will also ask you if you want to sent out a notification in the app. Coronamelder warns everybody who has been near you and who may have been infected.
- This includes people you know, but also people you do not know: people who otherwise would not have been contacted. This is how the app supports the contact tracing work being done by the GGD.
- In this way, users of the app can avoid infecting other people, even before they feel unwell. By staying at home, for example.
- The notification only tells them that they have been close to somebody who has tested positive, and on which day. It does not tell them who that person was, or where they were at the time.


The app helps to protect us from the Coronavirus. You can test the app in five GGD regions:
- Drenthe
- Gelderland-Zuid
- IJsselland
- Noord- en Oost-Gelderland
- Twente
