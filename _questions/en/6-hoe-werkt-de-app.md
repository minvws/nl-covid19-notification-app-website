featuredHomeText: The app sends you a notification if you have been around someone for some time, who has been infected with the coronavirus.

---

**The app sends you a notification if you have been near someone who has tested positive for coronavirus, if you were near them for more than 15 minutes. If you want to know whether you were infected, you can arrange a test with the GGD by telephone, free of charge. This can help you avoid passing the virus on to other people without knowing it..** 

<div class="md-timeline" markdown="1">
1. The app uses Bluetooth to detect other people who are around you, as long as they have the app too.
2. The closer you are to the other person, the stronger the Bluetooth signal is.
3. You do not need to enter your location, name, e-mail address, telephone number or any other contact details in order for the app to work. The app does not know who youare, who the other person is, or your location.
4. If you have been near someone with the app who later tests positive for coronavirus, the app will alert you of this.
5. If you test positive for coronavirus yourself, you can also choose to add this information to the app. This is voluntary. If you do this, the app will then alert all the other app users you have been near. The alert will only tell them the day on which they were near somebody who has tested positive. It does not tell them who that person was, or where they were at the time
