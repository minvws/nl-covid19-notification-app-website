- The app uses Bluetooth to detect other people who are near to you, as long as they have the app too.
- The closer you are to the other person, the stronger the Bluetooth signal is.
- The app works without knowing your location, name, e-mail address, phone number or other contact details. The app does not know who you are, who the other person is, or your location.
- If you have been near another app user who later tests positive for coronavirus, the app will notification you of this.
- If you test positive for coronavirus yourself, you can also choose to add this information to the app. This is voluntary.

If you have tested positive for coronavirus, you can choose to add this information to the app, with the help of the GGD. If a GGD employee calls you with the test results, they will also ask if you want to warn other people using the app. Recipients of such a notification will not be able to see who you are or where you were near each other. You can decide whether these notifications are sent: it is not compulsory and it is not automatic.
