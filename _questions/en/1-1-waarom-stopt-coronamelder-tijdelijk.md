Many of the coronavirus measures have now been lifted. As a result, the CoronaMelder app is much less useful at the moment. CoronaMelder gives you a notification with advice if you come into contact with someone who has coronavirus. Since you no longer have to stay at home after coming into contact with someone who has coronavirus, the app can no longer give you advice. And most people who test positive after a self-test no longer need to go to the Municipal Health Service (GGD) for a confirmation test. The app only works with confirmation tests from the GGD. As a result, far fewer notifications can now be sent. For these two reasons, the app is being temporarily discontinued. However, coronavirus itself is not yet gone. If the app once again proves useful in fighting the virus, CoronaMelder may become operational once again.
