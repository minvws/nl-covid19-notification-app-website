title: Will CoronaMelder still work with coronavirus apps from other countries?
---
The app will be temporarily discontinued on 22 April 2022. This means that the app will no longer work for the time being. From then on, you will therefore no longer receive notifications from apps from other countries and in addition, codes will no longer be exchanged with coronavirus apps from other countries.
