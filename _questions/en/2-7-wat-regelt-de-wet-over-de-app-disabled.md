title: What does the law say about the app?
---
The law that regulates the app states that nobody can force anybody else to download or use the app. Nobody – including employers, staff in a bar or restaurant, family members, friends or acquaintances – has the right to insist on this. You are completely free to choose whether you want to download and use the CoronaMelder app.

If you want to check the law for yourself, you can: the law is called the [Temporary Act governing the COVID-19 Notification Application](https://wetten.overheid.nl/jci1.3:c:BWBR0044194&z=2020-10-10&g=2020-10-10).
