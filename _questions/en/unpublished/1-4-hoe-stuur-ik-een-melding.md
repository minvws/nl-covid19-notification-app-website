If you test positive for coronavirus, you can choose to add this information to the CoronaMelder app. You can do so via the website www.coronatest.nl or in your call with the Municipal Health Service (GGD). You will then receive a personal GGD key made up of 7 numbers and letters. You can report this code using the CoronaMelder app. Only people who are really infected can send a notification.

After checking and sending your GGD key, the CoronaMelder system compares the codes from your telephone with the codes of people who are also using the CoronaMelder app. If your code was near to another person's code, that user of the CoronaMelder app will get a notification that they have been near an infected person. The app will not tell them who that person was.
