You will get a notification after:

- somebody uses CoronaMelder to report that they have coronavirus after a test with the GGD,
- and you were within 1.5 metres from that person for at least 15 minutes in the last few days.

This may be one person, or several. The CoronaMelder app counts all moments you were in contact with infected persons on one day. If this adds up to more than 15 minutes within 1.5 metres, you will get a notification.

But if an infected person just cycled past you in the street, you will not get a notification because you were not near that person for long enough to get infected. If there was a wall between you and the infected person, you will not normally get a notification either.

CoronaMelder does not know the identity of the people you met or where you met them. For example, you could have been:

- eating or drinking with somebody,
- in a shop,
- waiting in line,
- travelling,
- doing sport,
- at work,
- at school

for 15 minutes within 1.5 metres from an infected person. In that case you will get a notification later on.
