title: Is the app compulsory?
---
No, you are free to choose whether or not you want to use the app. This is your decision. Nobody can force you to use the app, not even your employer or staff in a bar or restaurant.

The law that regulates the app states that nobody can force anybody else to download or use the app. Nobody – including employers, staff in a bar or restaurant, family members, friends or acquaintances – has the right to insist on this. You are completely free to choose whether you want to download and use the CoronaMelder app.

## Is someone forcing you to download the CoronaMelder app?
Then you can report this to the CoronaMelder Abuse Line via telephone number: <a href="tel:+31881205100">088-1205 100</a> (local rate)
