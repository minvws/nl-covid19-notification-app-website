If you receive a notification, it means you have been near someone who has later tested positive for coronavirus. Don’t panic: this doesn’t mean for sure that you have coronavirus too. It means you have been in a high-risk situation: you could have been infected with coronavirus.

If you have caught the virus, you could pass it on to other people. Therefore, if you get a notification from the CoronaMelder, you should stay at home and get tested after five days. You should do this even if you have no symptoms (yet). All the information you need will be included in the notification.

## You do not need to get tested or stay at home if:

- you were fully vaccinated 14 or more days ago
- you have already had coronavirus and have also been vaccinated once (14 or more days ago)
- you have had coronavirus in the last six months

You should still be aware of your health. If you experience symptoms, stay at home and get yourself tested (again).

Call [0800-1202](tel:+318001202) or visit [www.coronatest.nl](https://www.coronatest.nl) to arrange a coronavirus test, free of charge.
