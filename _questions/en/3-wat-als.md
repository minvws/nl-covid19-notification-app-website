If you get a notification, it means you have been near someone who has tested positive for coronavirus. Don’t panic: this does not mean for sure that you have coronavirus too. It means you have been in a high-risk situation and that you could have been infected with coronavirus. 

Therefore, stay at home for up to 10 days from the date of contact with an infected person. This prevents you from infecting others as well.

Do you have complaints within those 10 days or after? Then contact the GGD to get a test.
