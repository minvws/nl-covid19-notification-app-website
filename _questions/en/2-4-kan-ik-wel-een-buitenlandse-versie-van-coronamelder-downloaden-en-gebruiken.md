title: Can I download a foreign coronavirus notification app if I am abroad in a place where this app is still operational?

You can. You will then receive a notification if you have come into contact with someone who is infected with coronavirus. It will not be possible to send a notification yourself based on a positive test taken in the Netherlands.
