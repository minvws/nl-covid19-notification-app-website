# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

This project has adopted a code of conduct for those that participate
in our Corona fighting effort; be it on Github, in issues, in pull request,
on mailing lists and other modes of communication within 
this project.

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
  * In a project this size, inevitably there will be people with 
whom you may disagree, or find it difficult to cooperate. Accept that, 
but even so, remain respectful. Disagreement is no excuse for poor 
behaviour or personal attacks, and a community in which people feel 
threatened is not a healthy community.
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
  * This is a large and complex project; there is always more to learn. It's good to ask for help when you need it. Similarly, 
offers for help should be seen in the context of our shared goal of improving our solution. When you make something for the benefit of the project, be willing to explain to others how it works, so that they can build on your work to make it even better.
* Showing empathy towards other community members
* Assume good faith
  * Contributors have many ways of reaching our common goal of 'fighting Corona'. Assume that
other people are working towards this goal.
* Try to be concise
  * Keep in mind that what you write once will be read by hundreds of 
persons. Writing a short message means people can understand the 
conversation as efficiently as possible. When a long explanation is 
necessary, consider adding a summary. Try to bring new arguments to a conversation so that each message adds something unique to the thread, keeping in mind that the rest of the thread still contains the other messages with arguments that have already been made. Try to stay on topic, especially in discussions that are already fairly large.


Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
 advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
 address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
 professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at https://www.government.nl/contact/making-a-complaint. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
